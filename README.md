# Pine Scripts Repo  
## William's Buy & Sell Signals  

This repository contains a Pine Script Indicator and Strategy for TradingView to generate buy and sell signals using:  
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: To detect overbought and oversold market conditions.  
- **Bollinger Bands**: For volatility analysis and breakout detection.  

It combines logic from the following TradingView strategies to filter out false signals and improve usability:  
- **Momentum Strategy**: Identifies the strength and direction of price movements.  
- **Price Channel Strategy**: Detects breakouts above or below predefined price levels.  
- **Channel Breakout Strategy**: Confirms trades based on volatility-driven breakouts.

## Logic and Flow  

### 1. Alternate Resolution Inputs  
The script allows users to analyze data at custom resolutions (e.g., monthly, weekly, daily) using the `reso()` function.  
- **Rationale**: Traders often analyze multiple timeframes to confirm trends. This feature lets users adjust the strategy for higher or lower resolutions as needed.

### 2. Smoothed Moving Averages (SMMA)  
The `f_smma` function calculates a Smoothed Moving Average for the open, high, low, and close prices.  
- **Purpose**: SMMA is less sensitive to short-term fluctuations compared to simple moving averages, providing smoother data for signal generation.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Calculate SMMA for key price points: open, high, low, and close.  
  2. Use these values to determine price trends and crossovers.

### 3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)  
The script calculates the RSI (`vrsi`) for alternate resolutions and uses it to generate trade signals:  
- **Oversold Signal**: RSI crossing above the oversold threshold triggers a buy signal.  
- **Overbought Signal**: RSI crossing below the overbought threshold triggers a sell signal.  
- **Rationale**: RSI helps identify potential reversal points in the market, ensuring trades align with momentum.  

---

### 4. Bollinger Bands  
Bollinger Bands are calculated to assess price volatility:  
- **Logic**:  
  - Upper and lower bands are computed based on SMMA and standard deviation.  
  - Crossovers with these bands indicate potential breakouts.  
- **Rationale**: Bollinger Bands help capture volatility and confirm breakout trades.  

---

### 5. Momentum Calculation  
The `momentum()` function calculates momentum values (`mom0`, `mom1`) to gauge the strength of price movements.  
- **Logic**:  
  - Momentum = Current price - Price *n* periods ago.  
  - Positive momentum strengthens buy signals, while negative momentum strengthens sell signals.  
- **Rationale**: Momentum ensures trades align with strong directional moves.  

---

### 6. Price Channel and Breakout Strategies  
- **Price Channel Strategy**:  
  - Tracks the highest high (`hh`) and lowest low (`ll`) over a set period.  
  - Confirms trades when the close price breaks above or below these levels.  
- **Channel Breakout Strategy**:  
  - Identifies breakouts using volatility-adjusted price bounds (`upbound`, `downbound`).  
  - Confirms long or short trades based on breakout direction.  
- **Rationale**: These strategies help detect and capitalize on major price movements.  

---

### 7. Execution Logic  
The strategy combines signals from all components:  
- **Buy Signal**:  
  - Long RSI signal, positive momentum, Bollinger Band crossover, and confirmed breakout conditions.  
- **Sell Signal**:  
  - Short RSI signal, negative momentum, Bollinger Band crossover, and confirmed breakout conditions.  
- **Rationale**: Using multiple conditions ensures robust signals with reduced false positives.

## Challenges  

### 1. Delay in Signal Labels Appearing on the Chart  
- **Issue**: Signal labels sometimes do not appear immediately on the chart due to how TradingView processes Pine Script logic on real-time versus historical data.  
- **Solution**: Use a **Chrome Auto-Refresh Extension** to periodically refresh your TradingView page. This ensures the labels appear promptly after conditions are met.  

### 2. Alerts May Not Always Trigger  
- **Issue**: Alerts can occasionally fail to trigger due to limitations in Pine Script's alert system or network latency.  
- **Solution**:  
  - Double-check that alert conditions are properly configured in the TradingView interface.  
  - Set up redundant alerts using alternative tools (e.g., email notifications or webhook integrations).

## How to Use  
1. Copy the script into TradingView's Pine Editor.  
2. Adjust parameters such as RSI length, Bollinger Band settings, and channel periods to suit your trading strategy.  
3. Add the script to your chart as an indicator or strategy.  
4. Use the alerts feature for real-time signal notifications.  
5. *(Optional)* Use a **Chrome Auto-Refresh Extension** for consistent label updates.
